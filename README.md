# snake_game
This is a simple snake game developed in python3 using pygame library.
There is a single main file named snake.py
to run the game you should run the following command : 
> python3 snake.py

the game starts by choosing the difficulty. three levels are availble : 
  - easy : the snake moves slowly and there are no borders
  - medium : the snake moves faster and if you hit the borders you loose
  - hard : similar to medium but with increased speed
 
 the game ends in two cases : 
  - if the snake bites itself
  - if the snake hits the borders (medium and hard levels)
 
 when the game ends, you could either restart from where you finished or quit the game. when you quit the game, your score is displayed on the screen before quitting.
